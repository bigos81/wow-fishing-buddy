# wow-fishing-buddy
Simple showcase of screen scraping and mouse input manipulation to automate fishing in popular MMO title

# how it works
## setup
1. Turn on WoW
2. Go to fishing spot
3. Open skillbook, or make fishing icon visible on the screen, screencap it (using snipping tool for example) - save the icon graphics to fishing-skill-icon.png
4. Cast fishing and screencap the fishing bobber and save it to fishing-skill-icon.png
5. Cath a fish prematurely such that you will get "No fish hooked" prompt on screen and screencap part of it - save it to nofish.png

## running
1. Make sure your fishing icon is visible
2. run the script, it won't take over your mouse untill you've pressed a key in the active console, so drag your consiole where you want it
3. press any key and let the script take over your mouse

## troubleshooting
- make sure your bobber image is apropriate to how your camera is set up (need a fresh bobber image every time you fish somwhere else)
- weather effect may require you to recap the bobber image
- anything obstructing you bobber visibility may trigger the script thinking the bobber moved, so fish in barren places
- any other players' bobbers will of course interfere

Remeber:
It's a showcase of capabilities, use it for educational purposes only.
Have fun! :)
